fasrcsw is a software management system where:

* apps are built, packaged, and installed using [rpm](http://www.rpm.org/)
* each app is installed under its own relocatable prefix (e.g. on shared storage)
* software environments are managed with [lmod](http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/tacc-projects/lmod)
* it's easy to manage entire software environments for multiple compiler and MPI implementations

See the [main documentation](doc/README.md) for more information.

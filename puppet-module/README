This is a snapshot of the puppet module we at FASRC are using to manange the
cutover from legacy environment modules to Lmod modules.  It has (almost)
nothing to do with software building, rpms, etc. that the rest of fasrcsw is
concerned with.  Also, it will likely become out of date, since it's an
independent copy of the code we're actually running.

It's the code behind our user documentation here:

https://rc.fas.harvard.edu/resources/documentation/software-on-odyssey/intro/

It includes the optional tweaks in the fasrcsw documentation, such as adding
more module load logging to Lmod.  Some stuff in files/legacy/ is from
https://github.com/fasrc/module-usage.

buildcomments       : This spec file currently only creates the module file.  The packages that are downloaded contain a number of prebuilt third party tools like libfortran and libjpeg.  Presumably because these *.so files have file references in them, rpm complains about prelink errors and then dies with a checksum problem.  Therefore, it has to be built in situ. No PATH is setup; the user is supposed to create an alias. Manual installation instructions were followed (http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/ciao_install/)

0.0.2 (future)
    * use the much better %make_install rather than %makeinstall

    * modulefile suggestions in actual lua code are now part of the output when 
      using --define 'inspect yes'

    * don't do any __os_install_post -- stripping, byte-compiling, etc.
	
    * bug fix: module files should be using the short release not the full rpm 
      one
    
	* bug fix: MPI family modules were not adding the correct dirs to the
      MOULDEPATH
